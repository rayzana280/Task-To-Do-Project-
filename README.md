# Adventure Journal

Welcome to Adventure Journal! This project is designed to inspire users to step out of their comfort zones and try new experiences. Users receive random tasks (like making a friend at an art gallery or trying a new restaurant) and can upload a picture and reflect on their experience.

## Description

Adventure Journal is a platform where users are given random tasks to complete. These tasks encourage users to explore new places, meet new people, and have unique experiences. After completing a task, users can upload a picture and write a reflection about their experience, creating a personal journal of adventures.

## Features

- **Random Task Generation**: Receive a new random task every day.
- **Photo Upload**: Upload a picture related to the task you completed.
- **Reflection**: Write about your experience and share it with others.
- **Profile Management**: Create and manage your personal profile.
- **Community Interaction**: View and comment on the adventures of other users.
